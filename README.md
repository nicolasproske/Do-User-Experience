## 👀 A First Overview

**Short and sweet:** Have you ever heard of the term "user experience"? If not, my Swift Playgrounds app called **Do U(ser) Experience?!** is a great place for you to start! Your tutor Robo is there to help you exploring the vast world of user experience within three minutes by giving you an interactive tour across several different interesting topics - So, what are you waiting for? Let's get ready! 🤖

**Longer:** It all started in 2019, when I got into app development through an internship alongside my computer science studies. Now, almost a year and a half later, I was able to gain a lot of new skills and had the honor of being one of the winners of last year's Swift Student Challenge, which also gave me the opportunity to publish my first app called [Paperworkout: Gym Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/paperworkout-gym-tracker/id1615266905).

I always enjoy figuring out something new and try to gain more and more experience to get better at what I do every day. Looking for a new challenge, this year's **WWDC22** came just at the right time for me: My chance to create a small project just using the iPad with the brand new "app mode" of the Swift Playgrounds app - No sooner said than done! With the project "Do U(ser) Experience" I want to show other people how important user experience is, especially when it comes to apps. The playful approach with a lot of examples makes it even easier for first-time explorers.
